      <description>In a previous post, I discussed my viewpoints on the 2015 / 2016 attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. While I stand by my intent in that post, the attacks appear to be a proof of concept and that this is a serious turning point in ICS adversary capability, I did make some mistakes, out of ignorance that I would like to clear up.
The mistake I made was asserting that those systems were very similar to one another, and that being able to pwn one meant you were able to pwn others.</description>
