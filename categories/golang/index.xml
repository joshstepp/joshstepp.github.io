      <description>If you have been to this site recently, you will have noticed that it doesnâ€™t look the same. I have migrated from Pelican, a static site generator written in Python to Hugo, a static site generator written in Go (golang).
Why? My old blog just wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it. The Pelican project updated and when I tried to migrate my local project from one computer to another with different versions I broke the site, which in turn went nuclear on my github repo for the project.</description>
