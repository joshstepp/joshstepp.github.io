      <description>As the New Year has arrived, I wanted to take this time, not to outline my resolutions or goals, but to write the post I wish I had when I got into reverse engineering/ malware analysis. Beware, there are numerous more resources than what is listed here, these are just resources I like and recommend.
Books Practical Malware Analysis by Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski
This was my first book on the subject and is a great primer to understanding malware characteristics.</description>

      <description>Malicious Microsoft Office files were extremely intimidating to me when I first got into information security because it seemed to always be the vector in which someone got pwned.

However, as I became more familiar with them, I have discovered they are actually easy to identify and can be fun to tear apart.</description>
