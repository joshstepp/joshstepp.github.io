      <description>My Homelab is a work horse for me; I use it to train smaller machine learning (tensorflow) models on, mess around with Starcraft AI bots on it, along with doing Information Security research and some light malware analysis/ reverse engineering. Essentially, it is a jack-of-all trades, master of none type of workstation.
Going in I had the following requirements:
 CHEAP… I want this to be under $300USD (not counting the GPU)</description>

      <description>This will be a multiple part post outlining my opinions of homelabs and what you should consider when building your lab. I will also include a few resources I can vouch for and have used. Furthermore, I do not claim to have all the answers and your setup/needs will be different from mine. That being said, I will start off in a general sense and narrow done as these posts go on.</description>

      <title>Pelican to GOpher: Migrating my Blog to the Hugo Framework</title>
      <link>https://joshstepp.com/post/migratetohugo/</link>

      <description>If you have been to this site recently, you will have noticed that it doesn’t look the same. I have migrated from Pelican, a static site generator written in Python to Hugo, a static site generator written in Go (golang).
Why? My old blog just wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it. The Pelican project updated and when I tried to migrate my local project from one computer to another with different versions I broke the site, which in turn went nuclear on my github repo for the project.</description>

      <title>ComboSex.py: A Simple Python Tool to Spark Creativity / Part 1</title>
      <link>https://joshstepp.com/post/combosexpart1/</link>

      <description>ComboSex.py is a simple Python Tool that uses a scraped word list to combine random word combinations in an effort to spark creativity. The tool was inspired by a blog post from James Altucher called &amp;ldquo;How to Make Millions with Idea Sex&amp;rdquo;. The principle is simple, combine two seemingly non-related objects to get the new hotness.
Dolls + Action = G.I. Joe
Space + Buddhism = Star Wars
Plus, millions of other examples you could come up with.</description>

      <title>Goodbye WordPress Hello Pelican</title>
      <link>https://joshstepp.com/post/goodbyewordpresshellopelican/</link>

      <description>After one year of dedicated blogging, I have decided to ditch WordPress in favor of Pelican for my current blogging needs. This change has many benefits that are more in line with my current mindset for this project along with being easier to push content out.
WordPress in general is great for an easy to use CMS. However as someone who enjoys python, Pelican was an easy transition. Additionally, due to Pelican being a static site, the server load required to run this blog is significantly lower, allowing it to be hosted on Github.</description>
