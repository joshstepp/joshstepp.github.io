      <description>In our last installment  of the Malicious Documents crash course we discussed the basics of Microsoft Office file formats, macros and used some open source tools to tear apart a random OOXML sample from the internet. By knowing the format and extracting the macros in a safe environment, we are able to see what type of actions this document is attempting to accomplish, and make a determination on how to triage this document.</description>

      <description>As the New Year has arrived, I wanted to take this time, not to outline my resolutions or goals, but to write the post I wish I had when I got into reverse engineering/ malware analysis.

Books Practical Malware Analysis by Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski
This was my first book on the subject and is a great primer to understanding malware characteristics.</description>

      <description>Malicious Microsoft Office files were extremely intimidating to me when I first got into information security because it seemed to always be the vector in which someone got pwned. Couple that with a ransomware sample getting loose on my homelab and “securing” a plugged in flash drive (nervous double mouse tap), I was traumatized.
However, as I became more familiar with them, I have discovered they are actually easy to identify and can be fun to tear apart.</description>
