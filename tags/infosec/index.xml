      <title>ICS Primer</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I discussed my viewpoints on the 2015 / 2016 attacks on the Ukrainian power grid. While I stand by my intent in that post, the attacks appear to be a proof of concept and that this is a serious turning point in ICS adversary capability, I did make some mistakes, out of ignorance that I would like to clear up.
The mistake I made was asserting that those systems were very similar to one another, and that being able to pwn one meant you were able to pwn others.</description>

      <title>Malicious Document Crash Course Part 2: Macros, APTs and OLE!</title>

      <description>In our last installment  of the Malicious Documents crash course we discussed the basics of Microsoft Office file formats, macros and used some open source tools to tear apart a random OOXML sample from the internet. By knowing the format and extracting the macros in a safe environment, we are able to see what type of actions this document is attempting to accomplish, and make a determination on how to triage this document.</description>

      <title>Reverse Engineering Resources for 2019</title>

      <description>As the New Year has arrived, I wanted to take this time, not to outline my resolutions or goals, but to write the post I wish I had when I got into reverse engineering/ malware analysis. Beware, there are numerous more resources than what is listed here, these are just resources I like and recommend.
Books Practical Malware Analysis by Andrew Honig and Michael Sikorski
This was my first book on the subject and is a great primer to understanding malware characteristics.</description>

      <title>Malicious Document Crash Course Part 1: Microsoft Office Documents and Macros</title>

      <description>Malicious Microsoft Office files were extremely intimidating to me when I first got into information security because it seemed to always be the vector in which someone got pwned. Couple that with a ransomware sample getting loose on my homelab and “securing” a plugged in flash drive (nervous double mouse tap), I was traumatized.
However, as I became more familiar with them, I have discovered they are actually easy to identify and can be fun to tear apart.</description>

      <description>Before I begin, I would like you to take note of the date in which this was published. If you are reading this in the future, there is a good chance some of this may change. I am attempting to make this post as evergreen as possible, just as precaution, your mileage may vary.
So, for the past six months or so, I have been plugging away at the Western Governors University Master of Science, Cybersecurity and Information Assurance program during all my free time.</description>

      <title>Home Lab Part II : My Setup</title>

      <description>My Homelab is a work horse for me; I use it to train smaller machine learning (tensorflow) models on, mess around with Starcraft AI bots on it, along with doing Information Security research and some light malware analysis/ reverse engineering. Essentially, it is a jack-of-all trades, master of none type of workstation.
Going in I had the following requirements:
 CHEAP… I want this to be under $300USD (not counting the GPU)</description>

      <description>This will be a multiple part post outlining my opinions of homelabs and what you should consider when building your lab. I will also include a few resources I can vouch for and have used. Furthermore, I do not claim to have all the answers and your setup/needs will be different from mine. That being said, I will start off in a general sense and narrow done as these posts go on.</description>

      <title>This Isn&#39;t a Lifestyle Blog but These are Awesome</title>

      <description>Many of my bigger projects have been placed on the back-burner as I have been focusing more on work, classes and spending time with my family. Although, I am not grokking down into the weeds on new technologies, I have stumbled across some nuggets worth sharing, even at the risk of sounding like a “lifestyle” blog.
Infosec Think-Piece
This essay has been making it&amp;rsquo;s rounds on infosec twitter however, I think it is worth reading to all those who are in infosec or are even curious about infosec/”cyber security”.</description>

      <title>The Real Cybersecurity News: The Ukrainan Power Plant Attacks and Why You Should Care</title>

      <description>Recently, there has been an overwhelming amount of discussion over WhatApp’s non-existent “Government backdoor”, which can easily be debunked with the following statement:
If Facebook wanted to allow any government to have a back door, they own the code base, they could just code one in. You wouldn’t know it. Additionally, the end points are still soft, you have to de-crypt the message to read it, which provides a much easier attack vector.</description>

      <title>Ransomware: The New Massively Disruptive Market?</title>
      <link>https://joshstepp.com/post/ransomware-new-market/</link>

      <description>Ransomware, malicious software designed to encrypt a victim’s hard drive and charge a ransom for the recovered files, has been reigning terror or organizations and users for a number of years now. The business model has always been simple, infect the user through spam e-mail or other vectors of infection (i.e. online droppers), encrypt the hard drive and hold it hostage until the user pays the ransom in Bitcoin. Rinse and repeat.</description>

      <title>How Infosec is Creating More Problems for Infosec</title>
      <link>https://joshstepp.com/post/infosecproblems/</link>

      <description>Information Security, cybersecurity or any flavor of security plus technology interest has skyrocketed and expected to grow exponentially. The reason is justified, criminals have moved into this section and been successful in exploiting victims for money then cycling those funds into developing more profitable ways to exploit targets. Furthermore, the domain of information technology provides a great return on their investment just by the scale at which these criminals can attack.</description>

      <title>Calm Down, It&#39;s Just DNS</title>

      <description>Last month Dyn, an “internet performance management company” or a DNS provider, was attacked by what looks to be some flavor of the Mirai botnet. If you remember, the Mirai source code was dumped after the original users spread it to get rid of some law enforcement pressure. Furthermore, this botnet targets weak security in the form of backdoors/passwords put into the firmware of “internet of things” devices, like webcams and DVRs.</description>
